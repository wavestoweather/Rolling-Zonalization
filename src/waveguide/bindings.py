    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array-like
        The input array.
    dtype : data type, optional
        The required data-type. If None preserve the current dtype.
    order : "C" | "F"
        Ensure a C- or Fortran-contiguous array is returned.
    shape : tuple, optional
        The desired output shape. Use `None` to mark a dimension of unknown
        size and integer to specify a dimension of known size (these will be
        enforced/verified). If the input array has fewer dimensions than
        specified in `shape` it is padded with size-1 dimensions from both
        sides until a compatible shape is found. If no compatible shape can be
        found, an exception is thrown.
    fold : boolean, optional
        When folding is enabled and the input array as more dimensions than
        specified in `shape`, additional dimensions of the array are flattened
        into the first dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    out : numpy.array
        The output array matching the specification.
    out_shape : tuple
        The shape of the output array.
    orig_shape : tuple
        The shape of the input array.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The specification cannot be enforced.
